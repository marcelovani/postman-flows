# Running Postman Flows in CI Without Paying for Enterprise — Our Workaround

We hit a wall. We had a perfectly organised Postman collection, a clean CI pipeline,
and a desire to run multi-step API flows automatically on every pull request. The only
thing standing between us and that goal was a paywall.

Here's how we got around it — without duplicating a single request.

---

## The Problem: We Wanted Flows, Not Just Folders

Our backend exposes a JSON REST API. We use Postman to document and test every endpoint.
After a while, individual endpoint tests started feeling hollow. They told us each request
worked — not whether the API held together as a system.

What we really needed to validate was *sequences*. The kind of journey a real client goes through:

- Admin logs in
- Creates an organisation
- Edits it
- Views it to confirm the change persisted

Or a more complex one involving two users — an admin who creates an organisation and sends
an invitation, and a member who logs in separately and accepts it. Each step depends on
the one before. The invitation ID from step four has to reach step five; the access token
from step one has to reach every authenticated request after it.

These aren't just endpoint tests. They're *user journeys* expressed as API calls.

Postman has a feature built for exactly this: **Flows**. It's a separate mode in the
desktop app — a visual canvas, distinct from the Collections view — where you drag
saved requests onto a board, connect them with arrows, and define the sequence without
writing any orchestration code. Each node represents a request from your collection;
variables pipe automatically from one step to the next.

![Postman Flows canvas — Organisation creation flow](images/placeholder.svg)
*The Postman Flows canvas showing the Organisation creation flow. Request nodes are connected by arrows; variable bindings are visible between steps.*

We started building flows there. They were clear, they were maintainable, and they
made it immediately obvious how the API was meant to be used. Life was good.

Then we tried to run them in CI.

## The Limitation: Postman Flows Require Enterprise to Run from CLI

Postman has a separate CLI tool (distinct from [Newman][newman], Postman's open-source
collection runner) that includes a `postman flows run` command. We got excited. We
[read the docs][flows-docs]. Then we hit this:

> `postman flows run` requires a Postman Enterprise plan.

![Postman docs showing postman flows run requires Enterprise](images/placeholder.svg)
*The Postman documentation showing that `postman flows run` requires an Enterprise plan.*


We're a small team. Enterprise pricing for a test-runner felt like a lot.

We searched for workarounds. The [community thread on running Flows in CI/CD][thread]
had been open since 2023 with no free solution. The [GitHub issue][gh-issue] requesting
Newman support for Flows had plenty of 👍 reactions and no resolution.

The fallback recommendation was the same everywhere: *convert your Flows to a Collection
and use [Newman][newman]*.

Which brings us to the real problem.

---

## Why "Just Use a Folder" Doesn't Work

For context: [Newman][newman] is Postman's open-source CLI runner. It takes a
collection JSON file and an optional environment file, fires every request in sequence,
and reports the results — pass/fail assertions, response times, the works. Free, no
account required, and a standard part of any Postman-based CI setup.

Newman can also organise requests into folders and run a specific folder with
`--folder`. The obvious approach: create a folder per flow, put the requests in the
right order, and run each folder. Sounds like the answer, right?

There are two problems.

**First, there's no sequencing across folders.** If your flow needs requests that live
in different folders — a login request from `Authentication/`, a create request from
`Groups/` — you can't compose them into a sequence without copying them. There's no
concept of "run this request from over there, then this one from here." You'd have to
duplicate every request that appears in more than one flow.

**Second, that duplication compounds fast.** Our collection had duplicate "Invite User"
requests — one under `Organisation`, one under `Groups`. That's already two copies of
the same request definition. Every time the endpoint changed, we'd have to update
multiple places. Scale that across login requests, setup steps, and teardown, and
you have a maintenance nightmare.

![Postman collection sidebar showing duplicate requests in different folders](images/placeholder.svg)
*Both copies of "Invite User" visible side by side under different parent folders — the duplication problem in plain sight.*

Postman Flows solve this elegantly on the canvas — you drag the same request block
into multiple flows without duplicating anything. But in a Collection, there's no
concept of a reference or alias. A request can only live in one place.

---

## What We Tried First: `setNextRequest()`

Newman supports a lesser-known API called `pm.execution.setNextRequest()`. Call it
from a test script and Newman will jump to a different request — even one in a
different folder — instead of continuing sequentially.

The idea: keep all requests in a `Requests/` folder (defined once), add a `Flows/`
folder with lightweight "entry point" requests, and have each entry point set up a
sequence of step names, then jump to the first one. A collection-level test script
(the Tests tab at the Collection level, which runs after every request in the run)
would read the sequence and route each step to the next.

```javascript
// Collection-level test script — the "flow router"
const stepsJson = pm.globals.get('_flow_steps');
if (!stepsJson) return;

const steps = JSON.parse(stepsJson);
const idx = steps.indexOf(pm.info.requestName);

if (idx === -1) return;

const nextIdx = idx + 1;
if (nextIdx < steps.length) {
    pm.execution.setNextRequest(steps[nextIdx]);
} else {
    pm.globals.unset('_flow_steps');
    pm.execution.setNextRequest(null);
}
```

Each flow's entry point request writes the step list into a global variable and jumps
to the first step. The router above then takes over, advancing through the list after
each request completes:

```javascript
// "Start: Organisation creation" entry point — test script
const steps = [
    'Organisation admin login',
    'Create Organisation',
    'Edit Organisation',
    'View Organisation'
];
pm.globals.set('_flow_steps', JSON.stringify(steps));
pm.execution.setNextRequest(steps[0]);
```

We got excited. We ran it. This appeared in the terminal:

```
Attempting to set next request to Organisation admin login
```

And then Newman stopped. One request executed.

![Terminal output showing Newman stopping after one request with --folder](images/placeholder.svg)
*"Attempting to set next request to Organisation admin login" — then Newman exits. Only 1 of the expected 4 requests executed.*


The issue: when you pass `--folder "Organisation creation"` to Newman, it only *loads* the
requests in that folder. `setNextRequest()` can reference any loaded request — but
`Organisation admin login` was in `Requests/User/`, a completely separate folder. From Newman's
perspective, that request didn't exist in the current run.

`setNextRequest()` works across folders when you run the *entire* collection without
`--folder`. But then you have no way to run just one flow — you'd have to run
everything, and the router would need to somehow skip requests that aren't in the
active flow. The state management quickly becomes unmanageable.

---

## The Collection Structure

Before diving into the solution, it helps to understand how the collection and
repository are organised.

The Postman collection is cleanly split into two top-level folders:

```
My API
├── Requests/          ← every request lives here exactly once
│   ├── User/
│   ├── Groups/
│   │   ├── Organisation/
│   │   └── Team/
│   ├── Authentication/
│   └── Media/
└── Flows/             ← documentation only, visible in Postman sidebar
    ├── Organisation creation/
    │   └── Start: Organisation creation
    └── Member invitation/
        └── Start: Member invitation
```

![Postman collection sidebar showing the Requests/ and Flows/ folder structure](images/placeholder.svg)
*The collection sidebar: `Requests/` expanded to show sub-folders; `Flows/` expanded to show the documentation entry for Organisation creation.*

The `Flows/` folder exists purely for discoverability in the Postman desktop app.
Anyone opening the collection can see what flows exist and what steps they contain.
The actual execution comes from JSON files in the repository — one per flow.

On the repository side, the structure is equally minimal. The collection and
environment files are exported from Postman desktop and committed to version control —
the same files you would use with a plain Newman run:

```
project-root/
├── mock-server.js                               ← local Express mock API (npm run mock)
├── test.js                                      ← starts mock, runs all flows, stops mock (npm test)
└── dev/
    └── Postman/
        ├── collection/
        │   └── my-api.postman_collection.json   ← exported from Postman (File → Export → Collection v2.1)
        ├── environments/
        │   ├── environment.local.postman_environment.json
        │   ├── environment.ci.postman_environment.json
        │   └── environment.mock.postman_environment.json
        ├── flows/
        │   ├── org-creation.json               ← Organisation creation flow
        │   └── member-invitation.json          ← Member invitation flow
        └── run-flow.js                          ← assembles and runs a named flow
```

---

## The Solution: Generate a Temporary Collection

We stepped back and asked a simpler question: *what does Newman actually need?*

Newman needs a collection file. It doesn't care where that file came from. So instead
of trying to make the collection aware of flows at runtime, we generate a
**temporary, flat collection** containing exactly the requests for a given flow —
pulled from the main collection — and run Newman against that.

Requests are still defined exactly once. The flow definition is a tiny JSON file
listing step names in order. A Node.js script does the assembly.

### The flow definition

```json
// dev/Postman/flows/org-creation.json
{
  "name": "Organisation creation",
  "description": "Organisation admin logs in, creates an organisation, edits it, and views it.",
  "steps": [
    "Organisation admin login",
    "Create Organisation",
    "Edit Organisation",
    "View Organisation"
  ]
}
```

```json
// dev/Postman/flows/member-invitation.json
{
  "name": "Member invitation",
  "description": "Organisation admin creates an organisation, a member logs in separately, the admin sends an invitation, and the member accepts.",
  "steps": [
    "Organisation admin login",
    "Create Organisation",
    "Organisation member login",
    "Invite member",
    "Accept invitation"
  ]
}
```

### The runner script

`run-flow.js` takes two inputs that already exist in any Postman project:

- **The collection JSON** — exported from the Postman desktop app (`File → Export →
  Collection v2.1`). This is the file you'd normally pass to Newman directly. It
  contains every request definition, test script, and variable.
- **The environment JSON** — also exported from Postman. It holds the base URL,
  credentials, and any other environment-specific values Newman needs to run.

The script reads both files, looks up the named requests, assembles a temporary
collection, and hands it to Newman:

```javascript
// dev/Postman/run-flow.js (abridged)
const flowDef = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(flowFile, 'utf8'));

// Find each named request anywhere in the collection — no duplication needed
function findRequest(items, name) {
  for (const item of items) {
    if (item.item) {
      const found = findRequest(item.item, name);
      if (found) return found;
    } else if (item.name === name) {
      return item;
    }
  }
  return null;
}

const flowItems = flowDef.steps.map(stepName => {
  const req = findRequest(collection.item, stepName);
  if (!req) { console.error(`Step "${stepName}" not found`); process.exit(1); }
  return req;
});

// Assemble a flat, temporary collection
const tempCollection = {
  info: { ...collection.info, name: `Flow: ${flowDef.name}` },
  item: flowItems,
};

// Run Newman programmatically
newman.run({ collection: tempCollection, environment: envFile, ... });
```

Run `npm test` to execute all flows — it starts the mock server, runs each flow in
turn, and shuts the server down on exit. Or run a single flow against a running server:

```bash
ENV=mock node dev/Postman/run-flow.js "Organisation creation"
```

### The output

*`npm test` output: mock server starts, both flows run with all assertions passing, server shuts down cleanly.*

## CI Integration

In GitHub Actions, the flows run automatically with a single command:

```yaml
- name: Run Newman — all flows
  run: npm test

- name: Store Newman artifacts
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
  with:
    name: newman-results
    path: tests/results/newman
    retention-days: 5
```

Adding a new flow requires no changes to `run-flow.js` or the CI workflow. Drop a
new `.json` file into `dev/Postman/flows/` and it's automatically picked up on the
next run.

![GitHub Actions run with Newman flow steps passing and artifact uploaded](images/placeholder.svg)
*A passing GitHub Actions run: the Newman flow step shows green, and the `newman-results` artifact is listed in the Summary tab.*

---

## What We Gained

- **No duplication.** Every request is defined exactly once. Flows are just ordered lists of names that reference it.
- **Free plan only.** No Newman patches, no Enterprise subscription, no cloud execution required.
- **Postman Flows canvas still works for design.** We kept using it to diagram and document flows — just not to run them.
- **CI-friendly.** JUnit XML and HTML reports are generated per flow and uploaded as artifacts.
- **Self-discoverable.** Drop a new `.json` file into `dev/Postman/flows/` and `npm test` picks it up automatically — no other changes needed.

---

## Limitations and What We're Watching

This approach is a workaround, not a first-class solution. A few honest caveats:

**`pm.execution.runRequest()` is the right answer — when it works.**
Postman shipped this API in 2025 and it does exactly what we wanted: invoke any saved
request from a script without duplication. The catch is it doesn't work in Newman yet.
If and when Newman gains support for it, our `run-flow.js` script becomes unnecessary.

**Step names must match exactly.** If someone renames a request in the Postman desktop
and exports the collection without updating the flow JSON, the runner will exit with a
helpful error message. It's a light coupling, but it's there.

**Parallel branches aren't supported.** Postman Flows can run request blocks in
parallel (the visual canvas supports it). Our sequential runner can't. For now, every
flow is a straight line — which covers the vast majority of API test scenarios.

---

## The Takeaway

To be blunt: this workaround is not as good as Postman Flows.

Flows give you a visual canvas where sequences are immediately legible — you can see
at a glance what connects to what, where variables flow between steps, and how branches
fork. Our JSON files and a Node.js script are a pale imitation of that. There's no
canvas, no visual debugging, no parallel branch support, and every flow is just a flat
list of names that must stay in sync with the collection by hand.

Postman Flows are a genuinely good idea. The frustrating part is that the CLI
execution is gated behind Enterprise. If your team is already paying for Enterprise,
stop reading this and use `postman flows run` — it's the right tool.

But if you're on the free plan and need multi-step API flows in CI without duplicating
request definitions, the underlying problem is solvable with the tools you already
have. A small Node.js script and a handful of JSON files gets you most of the way
there — just with none of the visual clarity that makes Flows worth reaching for in
the first place.

If you're in the same position, hopefully this saves you a few hours of searching.
And if Postman ever ships Newman support for Flows on the free plan, delete
`run-flow.js` and don't look back.

## Running the examples in this repo

The collection ships with a local mock server so you can run every flow without
a real API or a Postman account.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcelovani/postman-flows.git
cd postman-flows
npm install
npm test
```

That's it. `npm test` starts the mock server, runs every flow, and shuts the server down.
You should see both flows pass:

```
✅ Flow "Member invitation" passed.
✅ Flow "Organisation creation" passed.
```

### Running a single flow

```bash
# Start the mock server in one terminal
npm run mock

# Run a specific flow in another terminal
ENV=mock node dev/Postman/run-flow.js "Organisation creation"
ENV=mock node dev/Postman/run-flow.js "Member invitation"
```

### Pointing at a real API

Export your Postman collection to `dev/Postman/collection/` and your environment
files to `dev/Postman/environments/`, then run:

```bash
# Local API (uses environments/environment.local.postman_environment.json)
node dev/Postman/run-flow.js "Organisation creation"

# CI (uses environments/environment.ci.postman_environment.json)
ENV=ci node dev/Postman/run-flow.js "Organisation creation"
```

Set `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `MEMBER_USERNAME`, and `MEMBER_PASSWORD` as
environment variables (or GitHub Actions secrets) for the CI environment.
